### About

Biological systems operate under well-described rules. With this understanding, the green (agro) and red (human health) biotech industries can address critical needs. In agro-tech, the focus is on designing crops capable of producing biomass that can be efficiently converted into hydrocarbons. For human health, developing sensitive and specific tests for early-stage diagnosis of malignant neoplasms can significantly improve patient outcomes. These are challenging problems that require data from well-designed studies and the application of advanced data analysis methods. My primary concern is to determine, with high confidence, which molecular elements (e.g., germline variations or steady-state levels of RNA molecules) contribute to or are associated with specific endpoints of interest.
