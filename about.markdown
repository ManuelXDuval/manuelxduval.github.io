### Biotech opportunities  

Biological systems operate under well-described rules. With this understanding, the green (agro) and red (human health) biotech industries can address critical needs. In <b>agro-tech</b>, the focus is on designing crops capable of producing biomass that can be efficiently converted into hydrocarbons. In <b>molecular medicine</b>, developing sensitive and specific tests for monitoring the actual therapeutic effect of interventions could improve patient outcomes. These are challenging problems that require data from well-designed studies and the application of advanced data analysis methods. My primary concern is to determine, with high confidence, which <b>molecular elements</b> (e.g., germline variations or steady-state levels of RNA molecules) contribute to, or are associated with, <b>specific endpoints of interest</b>.
